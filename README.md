TODO:
- fix bug where buttons on East Bay & SF pages have green text for some reason
- figure out how we want to do navbar when collapsed/on mobile
- fix hamburger so it isn't just casually in the middle
- figure out how to pad navbar when collapsed/on mobile (donate button should not be right along bottom edge)
- link everything to home page (next to intro text)
- figure out flexboxes
- figure out why the hell my commits aren't going through
