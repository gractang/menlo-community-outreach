Hi Fellow Community Members and Friends!

We have reached out to the community organizations where One Bay and our Schools have a strong relationship to see how we might support them with the vulnerable members of our greater community that they support in this time of need.  If you are able to provide any assistance it would be greatly appreciated. For safety and simplicity's sake, please either ship the items you are able to donate directly to the organization or drop them off during the noted hours. Thank you for considering.

Sincerely,
Chris Young
Director of One Bay
Director of Community Outreach, Menlo School
