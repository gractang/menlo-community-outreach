              The Siena Youth Center of the St. Francis Center is a nonprofit organization
              whose focus is on helping families in need in the Redwood City area and
              attempts to assist such families in whatever ways will allow them to live
              in dignity and become self-supporting members of the community. We have
              provided a space for families who do not have the means to miss work and
              afford childcare or educational programs for their youth at home daily for the
              weeks of March 16 - April 3rd, 2020.

              To support the sharp increase in costs associated with protecting our clients
              and the unsheltered during this pandemic, LifeMoves has created the COVID-19
              Emergency Relief Fund with a matching gift from a group of anonymous donors.
              The Fund will support unexpected costs such as providing meals, buying
              personal protective equipment, covering professional deep cleaning services,
              and supporting our compassionate shelter staff with overtime pay.

              Palo Alto Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing provider, would like
              to distribute gift cards to our residents who are experiencing income
              loss due to changes and closures at their workplace. The impact is being

              whose centers are temporarily closed, among others.

              Our address is 1854 Bay Road East Palo Alto, CA 94303 (attn: Alicia Garcia). This is the mailing and physical address. We are open 24 hours a day. If someone brings donations after 730pm M-F or on a weekend, they need to go to the shelter door. These items will be used for the homeless individuals we serve in the shelter and for the street homeless served on Dignity on Wheels mobile hygiene unit.

            <p>
              Our Peninsula Bridge students and families are really suffering, facing lay-offs, working in unsafe conditions, and inadequate access to medical care. Many students don't have the technology and Wi-Fi to connect to the internet from home. Part of the strength of Peninsula Bridge is the sense of community that develops among our families, and the fact that we are extending a helping hand at this time would underscore our sense of community and—in that way—further our core mission.

            <p>
              Neighbors experiencing or on the brink of poverty are
              disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 public health crisis.
              Working families who rely on hourly wages are scared as shifts
              and pay are being cut. Help us reach our goal to help Second
              Harvest respond to the increased need and continue providing nutritious food
              all throughout Santa Clara and San Mateo counties!

            <p>
              Hoover Community School currently serves 740 Transitional-Kindergarten
              through 8th Grade students in the Redwood City School District.
              With approximately 95% of our students receiving free and reduced lunch
              and rents skyrocketing in the area, our families are struggling to stay
              in the area. Some students have attendance challenges and some are homeless.
              We now face an additional challenge, during shelter-in-place—
              students need iPads and internet access for remote learning.
              We greatly appreciate any support in our efforts to provide our students
              with the tools they need to learn under these trying times.
