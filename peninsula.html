            <p>
              The Siena Youth Center of the St. Francis Center is a nonprofit organization whose focus is on helping families in need in the Redwood City area and attempts to assist such families in whatever ways will allow them to live in dignity and become self-supporting members of the community. We have provided a space for families who do not have the means to miss work and afford childcare/educational programs for their youth at home daily for the weeks of March 16 - April 3rd, 2020.

            <p>

              To support the sharp increase in costs associated with protecting our clients and the unsheltered during this pandemic, LifeMoves has created the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund with a matching gift from a group of anonymous donors. The Fund will support unexpected costs ranging from providing meals, buying personal protective equipment, covering professional deep cleaning services and supporting our compassionate shelter staff with overtime pay. In addition, it would be extremely valuable to our shelters and staff on the front line if each household could donate just one bottle of sanitizer plus one roll of paper towel/toilet roll.

              Palo Alto Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing provider, would like to distribute gift cards to our residents who are experiencing income loss due to changes and closures at their workplace. The impact is being felt by restaurant workers with reduced hours as well as childcare workers whose centers are temporarily closed, among others.

              Our address is 1854 Bay Road East Palo Alto, CA 94303 (attn: Alicia Garcia). This is the mailing and physical address. We are open 24 hours a day. If someone brings donations after 730pm M-F or on a weekend, they need to go to the shelter door. These items will be used for the homeless individuals we serve in the shelter and for the street homeless served on Dignity on Wheels mobile hygiene unit.

            <p>
              Our Peninsula Bridge students and families are really suffering, facing lay-offs, working in unsafe conditions, and inadequate access to medical care. Many students don't have the technology and Wi-Fi to connect to the internet from home. Part of the strength of Peninsula Bridge is the sense of community that develops among our families, and the fact that we are extending a helping hand at this time would underscore our sense of community and—in that way—further our core mission.

            <p>
              As our community deals with the COVID-19 public health crisis, neighbors experiencing or on the brink of poverty are disproportionately impacted. Working families who rely on hourly wages are scared as shifts and pay are being cut. Second Harvest of Silicon Valley remains committed to providing nutritious food to anyone who needs it. Help us reach our goal to help Second Harvest respond to the increased need and continue providing food all throughout Santa Clara and San Mateo counties!

            <p>
              Hoover Community School currently serves 740 Transitional-Kindergarten through 8th Grade students in the Redwood City School District, of which seventy percent are English Learners, 94% are Hispanic and 11% are Special Education. With approximately 95% of our students receiving free and reduced lunch and rents skyrocketing in the area, our families are struggling to stay in the area. Some students have attendance challenges and some are homeless. We now face an additional challenge, that of the great digital divide during shelter-in-place— students need iPads and internet access for remote learning. We greatly appreciate any support in our efforts to provide our students with the tools they need to learn under these trying times.
