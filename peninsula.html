            <p>
              Our leadership met today taking the concerns of our families into consideration to make a decision based on our Siena Community Center program. With the school closures in effect, we have that as a stand-alone non-profit our mission calls to have a space for the families. Primarily for those who do not have the means to miss work and afford childcare/educational programs for their youth at home daily for the next three weeks March 16, 2020-April 3rd, 2020. Siena Community Center will operate from 8:30 am-6 pm the next three weeks for the only the first 40 youth who sign in and have no illness or family who is ill when checking in. We will operate as long as we are able. We will be closed from April 6-17, 2020 for our staff and program operation team. We can accept donations to Siena Youth Center during 10am-4pm times. Our address is 2625 Marlborough Avenue, Redwood City, CA, 94063; Call Rafael 30 minutes before arrival at 650-271-1939.

              Palo Alto Housing, a nonprofit affordable housing provider, would like to distribute gift cards to our residents who are experiencing income loss due to changes and closures at their workplace. The impact is being felt by restaurant workers with reduced hours as well as childcare workers whose centers are temporarily closed, among others.

            <p>
              The homeless population that we are privileged to serve is facing unique and serious risks associated with COVID-19. LifeMoves is working 24/7 to support our clients, our staff, and our community. We’ve had significant growth in our costs to support staff, order supplies and arrange for food. In response, and to support the sharp increase in costs associated with protecting our clients and the unsheltered during this pandemic, we have created the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Fund with a matching gift from a group of anonymous donors. The Fund will support unexpected costs ranging from providing meals, buying personal protective equipment, covering professional deep cleaning services and supporting our compassionate shelter staff with overtime pay. Your generosity really helps in the face of these unanticipated expenses. In addition, We are quickly running out of supplies. It would be extremely valuable to our shelters and staff on the front line if each household could donate just one bottle of sanitizer plus one roll of paper towel/toilet roll.

            <p>
              The most vulnerable populations are truly getting hit the hardest. Our Peninsula Bridge students and families are really suffering. They are facing lay-offs, working in unsafe conditions, and inadequate access to medical care. Many students don't have the technology and Wi-Fi to connect to the internet from home. While this is not directly part of our core mission, it is an emergency situation and our families are facing acute need right now. Part of the strength of Peninsula Bridge is the sense of community that develops among our families, and the fact that we are extending a helping hand at this time would underscore our sense of community and—in that way—further our core mission.

            <h3 class="primary-text">Hoover Community School</h3>
            <p>
              Hoover Community School currently serves 740 Transitional-Kindergarten through 8th Grade students in the Redwood City School District. Seventy percent are English Learners, 94% are Hispanic and 11% are Special Education. As a Community School, the school, families, and community partners work together to support the whole child and their families.
              Our low-income families face extreme economic challenges in this area. With approximately 95% of our students receiving free and reduced lunch and rents skyrocketing in the area, our families are struggling to stay in the area. We continue to tap into all of our community resources to support our families in greatest need. Some students have attendance challenges and some are homeless. Every day our teachers are committed to providing the best education for our students and laying the foundation for college and career. Despite the daily challenges our families face, our students have come to school ready to learn and prepare for their future. We now face an additional challenge, that of the great digital divide during shelter-in-place. They need iPad and internet access for remote learning. We greatly appreciate any support in our efforts to provide our students with the tools they need to learn under these trying times. Please feel to contact me at (408) 930-5953. Thank you for your consideration.

            <p>
              As our community deals with the COVID-19 public health crisis, neighbors experiencing or on the brink of poverty are disproportionately impacted. Working families who rely on hourly wages are scared as shifts and pay are being cut. Second Harvest of Silicon Valley remains committed to providing nutritious food to anyone who needs it. Help us reach our goal to help Second Harvest respond to the increased need and continue providing food all throughout Santa Clara and San Mateo counties!
